May 25, 2021 1:19:28 PM com.example.restservice.ChatBot <init>
INFO: In Greeting id = 2 content = In Australia, the people most at risk of getting the virus are:

 travellers who have recently been overseas

 those who have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19

 people in correctional and detention facilities

 people in group residential settings

People who are, or are more likely to be, at higher risk of serious illness if they get the virus are:

 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people 50 years and older with one or more chronic medical conditions

 People 65 years and older with chronic medical conditions. See this page on the Department of Health website for more information

 People 70 years and older

 People with compromised immune systems (see this page).

At this stage the risk to children and babies, and the role children play in the transmission of COVID-19, is not clear. However, there has so far been a low rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases among children, relative to the broader population.

There is limited evidence at this time regarding the risk in pregnant women.
